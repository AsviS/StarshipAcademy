##Starship Academy

Starship Academy is a Multiplayer WebVR Space Shooter made with A-Frame and Socket.io.

## Motivation

Charity, Jimmy, Eric, and Daniel built this game for their Capstone during Fullstack Academy's Software Engineering Immersive. They wanted to build a game that was literally out of this world, while incorporating technologies learned throughout the course. This project also gave them a chance to experience working with virtual reality and emerging frameworks like A-Frame.
