##Starshio Academy

Starship Academy is a Multiplayer First-Person Shooter game made with Aframe and Socket.io that can be played in either a 3D web version or in Virtual Reality.

## Motivation

Charity, Jimmy, Eric, and Daniel built this game as part of a Capstone for Fullstack Academy. We wanted to build a game that was literally out of this world while incorporating technologies that we have learned throughout Software Engineering Immersive.
